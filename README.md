# Project GOLDMAN

Project Goldman is designed to create new blindtests from its database or from your music.

## Installation

A few modules are required before running Project GOLDMAN:

```
bash
pip install flask
pip install pytube 
pip install moviepy
pip install wtforms
pip install rfc3987
```
or
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Download the whole folder.

Open the project and launch the app.py program. The site will open from the address: localhost:5000/
From there, it's up to you!

**Warning**: when launching the game, a long loading time may occur. Please wait until the game starts automatically.
**Other_warning**: This project was created with 5 other people in 2019, in a one-week shot after discovering Flask (bugs are to be expected!)
